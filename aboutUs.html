                <h3>Team Member: Joshua Yates</h3>
                <p>
                    Joshua Yates is a student in CSCI225 - Web Development - Fall 2021
                    at University of South Carolina Aiken (USCA). This project page is
                    a demonstration of skills learned and practiced with HTML5, CSS(3),
                    javascript, and other web development tools in addition to project
                    management- as the site had to be planned and built from scratch.

                <h3>Bug Report(s):</h3>
                <p>
                    Comments page unfinished due to issues with firebase db and time management failures.
                    Intended feature scope for the comments page was an anonymous "submit a message" text entry box
                    linked up to firebase db for data/message storage and retrieval.
                    General polish and finish on the site could and would be far better with more time; given that it
                    was a solo project and certain personal problems arose this is what was able to be completed in
                    time for the project deadline.
